# Security risk assessment report

Vulnerability:
Firewall not filtering ports

Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

1. Disabling unused ports / port filtering
2. Firewall maintenance
3. Hardware disposal and upgrades

Part 2: Explain your recommendations
The first recommendation is to disable ports that are not needed by the company. This will only allow traffic on certain ports which can decrease the surface attack on the firewall. It will also prevent malicious actors to enter the network through an open port.
Also maintaining firewalls is important because they may be hardware or software updates (depending on what the company is using) and ensuring that the proper ports are being filtered. By maintaining firewalls, it helps prevent unwanted attackers expose security vulnerabilities through improper firewall configurations or exploits. Maintaining firewalls should be done routinely to ensure proper upkeep of the network security.
And lastly, upgrading old firewalls to use newer technology like next-gen firewalls to take advantage of the robust security they have to offer. By using newer firewalls, they offer better protection because they are harder to attack. Resetting the old firewalls to their factory settings and also ensure that when disposing them will not allow potential threat actors from knowing the configuration of the network system. Upgrading firewalls should be done yearly or when the old firewalls are no longer supported by the manufacturer.
