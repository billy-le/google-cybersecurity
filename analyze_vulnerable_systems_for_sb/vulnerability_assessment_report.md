# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

## **1st January 20XX**

## ---

# **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# **Purpose**

Consider the following questions to help you write:

- _How is the database server valuable to the business?_
- _Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?_
- _How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?_

The purpose of this assessment is to identify vulnerabilities that a threat actor can take advantage of. The database server is a valuable resource since it hosts all the data that employees can access remotely. Due to the remote nature of the database, it is important to secure it from external threats by making the server private to those who can authenticated and authorized to do so. If the database were to be disabled, it can cause significant monetary and reputable damage to the company.

# **Risk Assessment**

| Threat source     | Threat event                                     | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :------- | :--- |
| _E.g. Competitor_ | _Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration_  | 1          | 3        | 3    |
| Hacker            | Gain access to the server and exploit weaknesses | 3          | 3        | 3    |
| Networking        | Distributed Denial of Service Attacks            | 3          | 3        | 3    |
| Power outages     | Poor infrastructure or natural events            | 1          | 3        | 2    |

# **Approach**

Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks to day-to-day operational needs.

My reasoning for listing the threat sources above because they all have to do with causing great harm to the company's resources. Since the database is public for anyone to use, these threat sources can easily access the system or shut it down completely which the employees and customers relies on. If we are able to secure the server, it will migitate these risks, protect digital assets, and adhere to the CIA model.

# **Remediation Strategy**

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.

I recommend implementing a defense in depth and principle of least privelege to secure the database. The company should clearly define roles and which each role can be given access to the data they are reading or modifying. This helps alleviates giving full control to any one person. And lastly, which is the most important, is to have an auth framework so users need to verify who they are and are authorized to perform their tasks. To strengthen security, the company can implement a multi-factor authorization so that a user needs more than one way to be authenticated in the system.
