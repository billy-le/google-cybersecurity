| **Risk analysis**    | Write **3 or 4 sentences** describing technical, operational, or managerial controls that could mitigate these types of attacks: _What types of malicious software could be hidden on these devices?

1. We found that the USB drive belonged to Jorge Bailey, a Human Resource Manager at Rhetorical Hospital. On the USB drive, there were various documents ranging from employee's shift
   schedule, new hire letters, and personal photos of his family and pets.

2. As an attacker, I can add malware to the USB drive so that if an employee stick it in the computer, I can gain access to the network. The documents that I put on there
   to pretend to be an employee is a distraction so that it can also affect multiple computers if the USB is being used by Jorge.

3. To migitate attacks such as USB baiting attacks, there should be company policy about not using any USB devices that were found or even personal ones that employees bring in to work.
   Another strategy is to use depth in defense to isolate sub-networks so that if can limit the amount of infected computers if employees accidentally plug it in.
